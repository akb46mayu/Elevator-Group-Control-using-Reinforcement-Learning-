# Elevator Group Control (Reinforcement Learning) (2014 Fall)



This project is modified according to COMP AML 150 courseâ€™s two assignments. The reading materials and the project questions can be found in the Reading folder. We implement the random concurrent policy, round robin policy, and policy rollout algorithm to control the elevator group in different instances (different number of floors and elevators). The project is based on the Relational Dynamic Influence Diagram Language (RDDL) simulator. We design a new policy by using the group action constraints, and our policy performs better than the others in rewards.
