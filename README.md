# Elevator-Group-Control-Reinforcement-Learning (2014 Fall)



We implement the random concurrent policy, round robin policy, and policy rollout algorithm to control the elevator group in different instances (different number of floors and elevators). Develop it based on the Relational Dynamic Influence Diagram Language (RDDL) simulator. We design a new policy by using the group action constraints, and our policy performs better than the others in rewards. 



This project is modified according to COMP AML 150 course’s two assignments.
